# hybrid-text
 
Experimental processing sketch to make the hybrid image visual effect
with different text.



## Examples




## Explanation

There are two types of text rendered, the close up (high frequency) and distant (low frequency) text. For viewers of the image the high frequency image will be more prominent at closer distances, while the low frequency image will be more apparent at greater distances (or when squinting their eyes).
